# react-kitchen
A simple app created using React, Flux &amp; Express API. Yeah, I love to cook. So decided to create a cute little app that simply
allows the user to create and remove recipes. 

App uses,

1. React (duh!)
2. React Router
3. Flux (yeah, next app is with Redux!)
4. Webpack
5. Bootstrap CSS
6. Express JS API
7. axios

## Kickstart React Kitchen

1. Install webpack
2. Clone app
3. Run "npm install"
4. At terminal / command prompt "npm run api"
5. At terminal / command prompt "npm run dev"
6. Hit http://localhost:8080/

Feel free to send a note if you find something that doesn't work. All ears!

Enjoy!
