# react-kitchen
A simple app created using React, Flux &amp; Express API. Yeah, I love to cook. So decided to create a cute little app that simply
allows the user to create and remove recipes. 

App uses,

1. React (duh!)
2. React Router
3. Flux (yeah, next app is with Redux!)
4. Webpack
5. Bootstrap CSS
6. Express JS API

Feel free to send a note if you find something that doesn't work. All ears!

Enjoy!
